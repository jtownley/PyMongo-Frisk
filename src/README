Description
----------------------------------

Wrapper for PyMongo Connection that offers additional application level monitoring.
When connecting to multiple MongoDB servers, allows you to verify connectivity to
MongoDB slave servers.

----------------------------------
Problem this solves
----------------------------------

Although the built in monitoring page for mongo is awesome it misses one situation.
This is when the mongo servers can talk to each other and the app can talk to the
master but the application has not been verified to be able to communicate with
the slave.

Usage
----------------------------------

Use it as you would pymongo and call the check health method on connection

    import pymongo_frisk as pymongo

    connection = pymongo.connection.Connection.from_uri("mongo://username:password@host1,host2/database")
    results = connection.check_health()

results is a dictionary as follows:
{'db_master_url': 'host2', 'db_slave_url': 'host1', 'db_master_can_write': True, 'db_slave_can_read': True, 'db_master_can_read': True}
